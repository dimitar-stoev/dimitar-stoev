# More about me [Dimitar Stoev](https://stoev.dev)

My name is Dimitar Stoev, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for developing a wide range of applications, from web technologies and representative websites to mobile applications. I'm a productivity geek with a strong belief in the hustle culture, and I strive to get things done on time with a high-quality product spirit.

I'm a strong believer in open source and free education, and that's why I am building almost all my projects in public!

I believe that understanding how technologies work and are implemented at a lower level is essential to providing better, high-quality service and consultation. That's why I prefer to work with serious technologies and write quality, well-tested code. My preferred stack includes Angular and VueJS on the frontend, and NestJS and Express.js on the backend.

I absolutely love writing articles, especially technical ones. Yes, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but there's just something about the challenge of explaining complex topics in a way that's easy for others to understand that gets me fired up.

Some people may find it a bit nerdy or boring, but for me, it's like solving a puzzle. The feeling of accomplishment I get when I finally figure out how to explain a difficult concept in a way that clicks for someone else is just priceless.

And let's not forget the humor - I mean, who doesn't love a good tech pun or two? Sometimes, when I'm writing, I like to throw in a joke or a witty comment just to keep things light and interesting.

But in all seriousness, writing technical articles is not just a passion of mine, it's also a way for me to share my knowledge with others and help them to understand the things that I find fascinating. It's a way for me to give back to the community and hopefully make a positive impact on the world. So yeah, you could say I'm a bit of a geek, but hey, someone's got to do it!

### Stoicism

I am a passionate believer in stoicism and spiritual and mental growth. I have read a lot of books on the topics and made myself a promise to try to be a real stoic.

And I think I am succeeding one step at a time.
